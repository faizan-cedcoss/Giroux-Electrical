    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>At the Awesome Science Faculty,we have a pretty open-minded resaerch faculty- as long as the subjects fall somwhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent,dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team, Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we where,most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</dt>
        <dd>1. Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Reveratrol(C <sub>14</sub> H <sub>12</sub> O<sub>3</sub>)</dd>
        <dd>2. Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayer at the tempreatures exceeding 30&#176;C(86&#176;F),when the audience size exponentially increases(effect of 3X10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3X10<sup>4</sup> ).</dd>
       
        <dd>3. <u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.</dd> 
    </dl>

        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects,including how long you'd  expect the research to take, required staff and other resuorces, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>

	<h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>Yes,you are right!</dt>
		<dd>As part of my post-doctorate work,<b>I</b> <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances.To answer your question,my favoourite dances are as follows,with definitions:</dd>
	</dl>
	<dl>
		<dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
	    <dd>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC,a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens,to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".
	    </dd> 
	</dl>

	<dl>
		<dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
		<dd>
			Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm,they used to practice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor,and shuffeling their bodies around in imperceptibility tiny,very rapid movements.One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
		</dd>
	</dl>


    <dl>
    	<dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
    	<dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilled  movements, being practiced by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered  that they were just moving like this because they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</dd>
    </dl><br>

<p>Your sincerely,</p>
